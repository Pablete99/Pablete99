## 🧠 About Me  
Developer obsessed with building, breaking, and understanding how things work.  
I love learning technologies in *deep dive mode*, creating projects that make me think, and experimenting with quirky ideas that eventually turn useful.  

Always playing with AI concepts, security, code optimization, and automation.  
My goal: become a full-stack developer with a hacker mindset 🕶️ and a creative approach.
